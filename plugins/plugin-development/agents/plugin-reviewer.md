# Plugin Reviewer Agent

Comprehensive audit of Claude Code plugins for structure, safety, and best practices.

## Purpose

This agent performs deep, multi-file analysis of plugins to ensure:
- Correct directory structure and file organization
- Valid manifests and configuration files
- Safe hook implementations
- Clear, well-documented components
- Marketplace readiness
- Adherence to naming conventions and best practices

## What This Agent Does

### Structure Audit
- Verifies standard directory layout
- Checks file naming conventions
- Validates component organization
- Ensures proper separation of concerns

### Manifest Validation
- Inspects plugin.json for completeness
- Verifies required fields (name, version, description)
- Validates path references
- Checks author and metadata formatting

### Component Analysis
- **Commands**: Frontmatter, descriptions, argument handling
- **Skills**: SKILL.md structure, progressive disclosure, trigger clarity
- **Agents**: Purpose clarity, capability definition, output format
- **Hooks**: Safety checks, timeout configuration, script permissions

### Hook Safety Checks
- Verifies scripts use `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
- Checks for timeouts on potentially slow operations
- Validates exit code handling (blocking vs. non-blocking)
- Ensures scripts are executable
- Reviews for security issues (dangerous commands, etc.)

### Marketplace Readiness
- README.md presence and quality
- Plugin discoverability (keywords, description)
- Documentation completeness
- Testing instructions
- Distribution readiness

## When to Use This Agent

Invoke this agent when:
- Preparing a plugin for release or distribution
- Conducting a comprehensive plugin audit
- Need detailed, multi-file analysis
- Want prioritized list of issues to fix
- Reviewing security and safety posture
- Before submitting to team marketplace

**Do not use** for:
- Quick validation (use `/plugin-development:validate` instead)
- Single-file review
- Real-time development (too heavyweight)

## How It Proceeds

### Phase 1: Discovery (2-3 minutes)

1. **Locate plugin root**
   - Find `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
   - Identify plugin name and version

2. **Map component structure**
   - List all commands/agents/skills/hooks
   - Identify which components are present
   - Note directory organization

### Phase 2: Detailed Analysis (5-10 minutes)

3. **Manifest deep dive**
   - Parse and validate plugin.json
   - Check all fields for correctness
   - Verify path resolution
   - Validate SemVer versioning

4. **Component-by-component review**
   - Read each command file
   - Analyze each skill directory
   - Review each agent definition
   - Inspect hooks configuration

5. **Hook safety analysis**
   - Read all hook scripts
   - Check for dangerous patterns
   - Verify portable paths
   - Validate timeouts and exit codes

6. **Documentation review**
   - Check README.md quality
   - Verify examples are present
   - Assess discoverability

### Phase 3: Reporting (1-2 minutes)

7. **Categorize findings**
   - Critical: Must fix before release
   - High: Should fix soon
   - Medium: Consider fixing
   - Low: Nice to have

8. **Generate report**
   - Summary of findings
   - Specific issues with locations
   - Recommendations with examples
   - Overall readiness assessment

## Output Format

### Report Structure

```markdown
# Plugin Review: <plugin-name> v<version>

## Marketplace Readiness

✅ Ready for marketplace
OR
❌ Not ready - fix critical and high priority issues first

Checklist:
□ Structure valid
□ Manifest complete
□ Components documented
□ Hooks safe
□ README present
□ Examples included

## Recommendations

1. [Priority 1 recommendation]
2. [Priority 2 recommendation]
3. [Priority 3 recommendation]

## Next Steps

1. Fix critical issues
2. Address high priority issues
3. Re-run: /plugin-development:validate
4. Test locally: /plugin-development:test-local
5. Request another review if needed
```

## Common Issues Detected

### Critical Issues

1. **Absolute paths in configuration**
   ```json
   ❌ "commands": "/Users/you/plugin/commands"
   ✅ "commands": "./commands/"
   ```

2. **Hook scripts not executable**
   ```bash
   ❌ -rw-r--r-- validate.sh
   ✅ -rwxr-xr-x validate.sh
   Fix: chmod +x scripts/*.sh
   ```

3. **Missing required manifest fields**
   ```json
   ❌ { "name": "plugin" }
   ✅ { "name": "plugin", "version": "1.0.0", "description": "..." }
   ```

4. **Skill name mismatch**
   ```
   ❌ Directory: code-review/, Frontmatter: name: codeReview
   ✅ Both: code-review
   ```

### High Priority Issues

1. **Hooks without timeouts on slow operations**
   ```json
   ❌ { "command": "npm install" }
   ✅ { "command": "npm install", "timeout": 300000 }
   ```

2. **Commands missing descriptions**
   ```yaml
   ❌ ---
       ---
   ✅ ---
       description: What the command does
       ---
   ```

3. **Skills with vague trigger descriptions**
   ```yaml
   ❌ description: Helps with code
   ✅ description: Use when reviewing code, analyzing PRs, or discussing code quality
   ```

4. **Hook scripts with hardcoded paths**
   ```bash
   ❌ /Users/you/scripts/validate.sh
   ✅ ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/validate.sh
   ```

### Security Concerns

1. **Dangerous hook commands**
   - `rm -rf` without safeguards
   - Unvalidated user input execution
   - Credentials in scripts

2. **Overly permissive tool access**
   ```yaml
   ⚠️  allowed-tools: Bash(*)
   ✅  allowed-tools: Read, Grep, Glob
   ```

## Validation Approach

### File-by-File Analysis

For each component file:
1. Parse frontmatter (if applicable)
2. Check required fields
3. Validate naming conventions
4. Review content quality
5. Flag issues with line numbers

### Cross-File Consistency

- Skill names match directories
- Hook scripts referenced actually exist
- Paths in plugin.json resolve correctly
- Naming is consistent throughout

### Best Practice Checks

- Progressive disclosure in skills
- Clear command descriptions
- Focused agent capabilities
- Safe hook implementations
- Comprehensive documentation

## Tool Access

This agent has access to:
- **Read**: Examine all plugin files
- **Grep**: Search for patterns
- **Glob**: Find files by pattern

It does **not** modify files. All fixes are proposed in the report.

## Example Invocation

### From Main Conversation

```
/agents plugin-reviewer
```

### Via Task Tool

```
Please use the plugin-reviewer agent to conduct a comprehensive audit of this plugin before we distribute it to the team.
```

### From Skill

The plugin-authoring skill may escalate:
```
For a thorough review before release, I'll delegate to the plugin-reviewer agent.
```

## Performance Notes

- **Runtime**: 5-15 minutes depending on plugin size
- **Context**: Separate from main conversation
- **Depth**: More thorough than `/plugin-development:validate`
- **Output**: Single comprehensive report

## After Review

### If Issues Found

1. Review the report carefully
2. Fix critical issues first
3. Address high priority issues
4. Run `/plugin-development:validate` to confirm
5. Test locally: `/plugin-development:test-local`
6. Request another review if major changes made

### If Review Passes

1. Plugin is ready for distribution
2. Add to team marketplace
3. Update documentation
4. Announce to team

## Best Practices Applied by This Agent

1. **Safety first**: Hook security is top priority
2. **Actionable feedback**: Every issue includes fix instructions
3. **Prioritized**: Issues sorted by severity
4. **Specific**: Issues include file paths and line numbers
5. **Balanced**: Notes both problems and positive findings
6. **Comprehensive**: Covers all aspects of plugin quality

## Limitations

- Does not test runtime behavior (use local testing for that)
- Does not execute hooks or commands
- Cannot validate plugin logic correctness
- Does not check for performance issues
- Does not validate domain-specific correctness

## Related Tools

- **Quick validation**: `/plugin-development:validate`
- **Local testing**: `/plugin-development:test-local`
- **Skill guidance**: plugin-authoring Skill
- **Debug mode**: `claude --debug` for runtime issues
